# **Comparison of methods 📊**

This section compares the methods `ee.data.computePixels` and `ee.data.getPixels` with more traditional data download methods, such as `Export` and `getDownloadUrl`, focusing on their application in deep learning workflows and overall performance.


- **`Export`**: 📦 Useful for exporting large datasets or entire collections, but involves significant backend overhead to start and manage export tasks, often resulting in longer wait times for the data to be ready. This is less ideal for real-time or high-frequency deep learning data preparation where immediate data access is critical.
- **`getDownloadUrl`**: 🌐 Provides direct download via a URL but lacks server-side pre-processing capabilities, requiring all data manipulation to be performed locally. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for deep learning tasks that involve large amounts of data and require extensive preprocessing.
- **Efficiency gains with `getPixels` and `computePixels`**:
  - **`computePixels`** can provide significant speed improvements by pre-processing data directly on the server, reducing both the download size and the computational load on local systems, which is essential for deep learning workflows that involve large datasets.
  - **Reduced candwidth usage**: 📉 Since only the necessary data is downloaded, bandwidth usage is minimized, which is particularly important when handling large amounts of data for training deep learning models.


| Method                         | Download speed                     | Pre-processing | Use case                                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **`ee.data.getPixels`**            | ⚡ Fast (minimal server processing)   | ❌ No             | Retrieving unprocessed satellite images for flexible local processing in deep learning.                |
| **`ee.data.computePixels`**        | 🕒 Moderate (due to server processing)| ✅ Yes            | Applying preprocessing tasks (e.g., normalization, cloud masking) directly on the server before downloading for deep learning workflows.   |
| **`Export`**                   | 🐢 Slow due to backend processing and queuing | ✅ Yes (on the server) | Suitable for exporting large datasets or entire collections, but less efficient for high-frequency data preparation in deep learning. |
| **`getDownloadUrl`**           | 🕑 Moderate (depending on dataset size) | ❌ No | Direct download of specific images or data selections without pre-processing, requiring all manipulations to be done locally. |
